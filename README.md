# PyJPEG

Implementation of JPEG in Python. Primary use is educational.

Heavily inspired on 
[this explanatory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2aEzeMDHMA) 
by [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-y-6csu5WGm29I7JiwpnA).

## Examples

The following notebooks contain useful examples:
- compress and decompress image with [this notebook](notebooks/compress-and-decompress-image.ipynb).
- walk-through of the code in [this notebook](notebooks/200227-pydata-meetup.ipynb).
- apply a discrete cosine transform to an image [this notebook](notebooks/discrete-cosine-transform.ipynb).
- apply an inverse discrete cosine transform to an image [this notebook](notebooks/inverse-discrete-cosine-transform.ipynb).

## Links

- [The wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG) explains clearly the
  different steps of the JPEG - actually the JFIF - algorithm.
- [This article](https://unix4lyfe.org/dct/) was helpful to understand the
  inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT).
